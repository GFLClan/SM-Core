# GFL Core
## Description
GFL's Core plugin used to connect all of our sub-plugins together including Server Hop, Server Ads, and more.

This plugin introduces a native function all other plugins can use for logging messages.

## ConVars
* `sm_gflcore_logging` => Enable logging using the native GFL Core utilizes (default `1`).
* `sm_gflcore_loggingpath` => Path to store log files in starting from `addons/sourcemod/` (default `"logs/GFL/"`).
* `sm_gflcore_logprint` => When the logging native is called, should we print to the server console as well (default `1`)?
* `sm_gflcore_ad_flag` => Users with this flag will be able to disable server advertisements from within the Server Ads plugin (default `"a"`).
